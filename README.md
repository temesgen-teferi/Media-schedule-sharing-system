# Amhara Media Corporation 
<!-- is one of these communication companies. So, I tried to create information sharing platform for program technicians program managers and supervisors. 
This project is web-based and is easily accessible to employees in the company.
When I were in the company FOR INTERN I observed that shift managers and streaming technicians 
had some limitations of sharing the schedule of the programs to be streamed on that shift. 
 And they communicate through printed programs on paper. So I try to solve this specific problem through web-based schedule sharing platform 
with Managers page to add, edit , and delete programs
Technicians page to access the programs for streaming -->
